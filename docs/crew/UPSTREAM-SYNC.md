# Upstream Sync Runbook

## Repository topology

```text
upstream  https://github.com/block/buzz.git      fetch only
origin    https://github.com/Nuncio-hq/crew.git  fetch and push
```

Crew is a GitHub fork, not an unrelated copy. Keep GitHub's fork relationship
and the local `upstream` remote.

The machine-readable baseline is
[`upstream-buzz.json`](upstream-buzz.json). Updating it is an explicit sync
decision, not a side effect of building or releasing NuncioCrew.

The local upstream push URL is deliberately disabled. Never push to
`block/buzz`.

## Thin-fork rules

- Prefer Crew-owned files under a new namespace.
- Do not restyle or reorganize upstream code.
- Do not copy upstream modules into parallel Crew versions.
- Existing upstream-file edits require explicit justification.
- The normal UI integration budget is one route-registration edit and one
  navigation-entry edit.
- A Rust edit requires a failed or insufficient non-Rust spike plus explicit
  approval.
- Keep `main` green.
- Use short-lived area branches; do not create long-lived component branches.
- Perform upstream integration on `sync/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Before feature work

```bash
git status --short --branch
git fetch --prune origin
git fetch --prune upstream
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

If `main` is not clean, stop. Do not hide or discard local changes.

## Sync procedure

```bash
git fetch --prune upstream
git fetch --prune origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch -c sync/upstream-YYYY-MM-DD
git merge --no-edit upstream/main
```

Then:

1. Record the chosen Buzz version, tag, and exact merged commit in
   `upstream-buzz.json`.
2. Inspect every conflict as a fork-maintenance signal.
3. Prefer moving Crew behavior into additive files over repeatedly resolving
   the same upstream file.
4. Run focused tests for conflict areas.
5. Run upstream's required quality gates.
6. Review the fork delta:

```bash
git diff --stat upstream/main...HEAD
git diff --name-status upstream/main...HEAD
```

1. Push the sync branch and merge it through a reviewed PR into Crew `main`.

## Feature branches

Use short-lived, area-prefixed names, for example:

```text
docs/crew-foundation
project/local-workspace-location
board/event-projection
agents/project-context
sync/upstream-2026-07-30
```

Branch names describe durable product areas, not plan phase numbers or audit
codes.

## Conflict policy

When upstream changes one of Crew's few edited files:

1. Re-read the upstream intent.
2. Reapply only the smallest Crew hook.
3. Move new logic into Crew-owned files.
4. Run the relevant upstream test and Crew contract test.
5. Record a decision if the maintenance boundary changes.

Do not resolve conflicts by keeping "ours" wholesale.

## Fork-drift review

After every upstream sync, classify the delta:

| Class                                 | Expected action                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Added Crew file                       | Normal                                     |
| Route/nav hook                        | Keep tiny and inspect manually             |
| Upstream file with repeated conflicts | Redesign integration boundary              |
| Rust modification                     | Revalidate the spike evidence and approval |
| Copied upstream implementation        | Remove or replace with composition         |

The goal is not a zero diff. The goal is a small, understandable, replayable
diff whose maintenance cost is visible.

## Recovery

If a sync branch becomes confused, do not rewrite or reset a dirty user
checkout. Preserve the branch, create a fresh sync branch from clean `main`,
and compare the attempts. Destructive Git recovery requires explicit approval.
